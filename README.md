# -Real-Time-Vehicle-Tracking-Counting
Real-Time Vehicle Tracking &amp; Counting with YOLO
This project performs real-time vehicle detection, tracking, and counting using YOLO and object tracking techniques. It identifies vehicles such as cars, buses, trucks, and motorcycles, assigns a unique ID to each, and tracks their movement across frames to avoid double counting.

The system processes both images and video streams, draws bounding boxes with labels, and saves the output frames for further analysis. It can be extended to monitor traffic flow, detect congestion, and support smart city applications.

This project is ideal for traffic monitoring, intelligent transportation systems, and road analytics. It serves as a beginner-friendly yet practical implementation of computer vision in the automotive domain.

Future enhancements may include vehicle speed estimation, wrong-direction detection, lane-based counting, and real-time dashboards for visualization.
